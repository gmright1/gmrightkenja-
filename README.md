 uptown build and pass text source travis's 
Except every files should be included into language matter
If your text and my text match then we should  build this here
If you already merged and control my repo like your repo and help more with the contribute 
Then this text can pass here even this repo was mine but somehow you got it solved or rebuilt more like how I wanted 
Then the is not reason I should keep you away from beginning this repository I can't be the reason you not moving on

If you pass this first you will have to include  the foundation of the repo(ownership) it matter but you won't be able to have 
Full access  even if you the one who pass this like text policymaking by github.com/georgemakulu
It's not late or is late this work is in my flow now you will flow with me
