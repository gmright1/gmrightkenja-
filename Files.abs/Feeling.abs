I wish the was a school where I can go to and learn about that one person who I always in love with but what I came to found out is that being in love or being loved with someone  it's a blind spot in life the is little of people who can be able to see it and a lot of them cannot see it ,  in my life I was always running or hiding from the way I feel about you because to me you not just beautiful but you are unique  and special with all the names that a beautiful woman can be called yes I was scared to tell you this since Moz because you were always with those cool people around you and that made me feel like even if I try to tell you how I feel you won't accept me  ilikuwa ina niumiza sana  I guess I scare to know how you will react to me when I tell you this , that you the most amazing creation of god and if the world üåçwas mine I was going  to give all to you , my silence was keeping me in darkness case but every time when I think of you the is always bright light shining like a starüéë  from thousands miles even I never had a chance to open myself to you but believe me I'm always thinking about  you Knowing it will be difficult for me to  tell you Nakupenda ‚ù£ to me my life is not balance without seeing your existence I even got lost in so many way to get here where I am right now in this position with you because of my fear
