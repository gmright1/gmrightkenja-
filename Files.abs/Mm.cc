Sooo Paul and I got back from Nebraska last night about midnight. And Paul just got home from work and needs to pack to leave for out of town immediately after work tomorrow for a week. Soooo we need to unpack so he can then repack to leave tomorrow. So we won't be there tonight, but I will plan to be there next Monday. But Paul won't be back yet next week either.
